# FLW3 Editor
FLW3 Editor is an application used for editing the FLW3 section of the `.msbf` format from Nintendo's LMS library. This section is most notably used in several 3DS, Wii and Wii U games. Some examples of games are:

* Animal Crossing: New Leaf
* Nintendo Badge Arcade
* The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds
* The Legend of Zelda: Triforce Heros

This application is dedicated for researching the format, for an eventual node editor application to be developed.

What is supported:
* Viewing flowcharts in a list format.
* Editing node parameters.
* Adding nodes.
* Adding branches, deleting branches.
* Adding flowcharts.
* Creating new files.
* Using extensions to document nodes.
