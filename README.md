# FLW3 Editor
FLW3 Editor is an application used for editing revision 3 of the `.msbf` format from Nintendo's LMS library. This version is most notably used in several 3DS and Wii U games. Some examples of 3DS games are:
* Tomodachi Life

* Viewing flowcharts in a list style format
* Editing node parameters
* Adding branches, deleting branches.
* Adding flowchart.
* Creating new files
